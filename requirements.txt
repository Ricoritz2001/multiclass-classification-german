# Requirements

# Core Dependencies:
pandas                 # For handling and manipulating data
numpy                  # For numerical computations
scikit-learn           # Classical ML models and utilities (Logistic Regression, RandomForest, SVM, KNN)
xgboost                # XGBoost model implementation
joblib                 # For saving and loading trained models and encoders

# Text Preprocessing:
nltk                   # Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing and stopwords
spacy                  # NLP pipeline used in classical models
wordcloud              # For generating word cloud visualizations

# Hugging Face and PyTorch for Transformer Models:
transformers[torch]    # Hugging Face Transformers library for state-of-the-art models
datasets               # Hugging Face Datasets for managing the training/evaluation data
evaluate               # Hugging Face Evaluate library for metric computations
torch                  # PyTorch for model training (CPU/GPU)
torchaudio             # PyTorch audio utilities (required in conda setup)
torchvision            # PyTorch vision utilities (used in conda setup)
tensorflow             # For certain transformer-based models, optional backend
tf-keras               # Ensures compatibility with Hugging Face when using TensorFlow

# Visualization:
matplotlib             # For plotting and visualization
seaborn                # For enhanced statistical plotting
